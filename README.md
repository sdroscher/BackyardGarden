# BackyardGarden

A mobile-responsive web app for managing planting schedules, tracking seed plantings, and receiving iOS reminders via Prowl.

Built with **Elixir + Phoenix LiveView + Postgres**, deployed to **fly.io**.

## Features

**Seed Library** — Build a personal seed collection with live search and filtering. Add seeds from the supplier catalog (browse or paste a URL), or enter them manually. Each seed has a detail page with care information pulled from the supplier.

**Planting Schedules** — Log plantings from seed to harvest. Track the full indoor seedling lifecycle: sow in trays, harden outdoors, transplant. Get planting window badges and Plant Now recommendations based on today's date.

**Garden Dashboard** — At-a-glance view of what to plant now, what's recently been planted, and what's coming up. Includes a live weather card with contextual planting tips.

**Planting Calendar** — Monthly grid showing your planted items alongside each seed's ideal planting window, so you can plan at a glance.

**Garden Zones** — Define growing zones (bed, greenhouse, container, etc.) with sun, soil, and microclimate properties. The app recommends compatible zones when logging a new planting.

**iOS Notifications** — Morning and evening push notifications via [Prowl](https://www.prowlapp.com/). Alerts for plant-now windows, harvest countdowns, seedling sow dates, hardening reminders, and weather warnings (rain, high wind, heat).

**Supplier Catalog** — Scraped product data from West Coast Seeds, Metchosin Farm, and Brother Nature. Care guides are shown on seed detail pages and linked back to the supplier listing.

**Multi-user** — Auth0 login (Google or email/password). Each user's seeds, plantings, and zones are private to their account.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.18+ and Erlang/OTP 27+ (install via [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/))
- Phoenix 1.8+
- PostgreSQL 14+ running locally

```bash
asdf plugin add erlang && asdf install erlang 27.2
asdf plugin add elixir && asdf install elixir 1.18.2-otp-27
mix archive.install hex phx_new
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (auto-loaded in dev via dotenvy):

```
# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/backyard_garden_dev

# Auth0 (required — see Auth0 Setup below)
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Cloak encryption key (required — see Generating a Cloak Key below)
CLOAK_KEY=base64_encoded_32_byte_key

# Weather (optional)
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_key_here
DEFAULT_LOCATION=Victoria,CA        # format: City,CountryCode
TIMEZONE=America/Vancouver          # IANA timezone name

# Prowl notifications (optional — configurable via /settings/notifications)
# PROWL_API_KEY=your_prowl_key_here
```

**Env var notes:**
- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection URL; required in dev and prod
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` — required for login to work; the app will start without them but the OAuth callback will fail
- `CLOAK_KEY` — required in production; a hard-coded dev fallback is used if omitted in dev/test
- `DEFAULT_LOCATION` and `TIMEZONE` — have sensible defaults if omitted
- `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` — weather card is silently hidden if missing
- `PROWL_API_KEY` — set via the `/settings/notifications` page (no env var required)

### Setup

```bash
# Install deps, create & migrate Postgres DB, build assets
mix setup

mix phx.server
```

Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). You will be redirected to Auth0 to log in.

> **Note:** Tests run against SQLite (auto-created, no setup required). Dev and prod use Postgres via `DATABASE_URL`.

### Tests

```bash
mix test
```

---

## Auth0 Setup

### 1. Create an Auth0 Application

1. Sign in to [manage.auth0.com](https://manage.auth0.com/)
2. Go to **Applications → Applications → Create Application**
3. Choose **Regular Web Application**, name it "BackyardGarden"
4. Click **Create**

### 2. Configure Allowed URLs

In the application settings, set:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Allowed Callback URLs | `http://localhost:4000/auth/auth0/callback` |
| Allowed Logout URLs | `http://localhost:4000/auth/auth0` |

For production, add your production domain alongside localhost (comma-separated).

### 3. Enable Social Connections (optional)

To enable Google login:

1. Go to **Authentication → Social**
2. Enable **Google / Gmail**
3. Auth0 provides shared dev credentials for testing; supply your own Google OAuth app credentials for production

### 4. Copy Credentials

From the **Settings** tab of your application, copy:

- **Domain** → `AUTH0_DOMAIN` (e.g. `your-tenant.auth0.com`)
- **Client ID** → `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
- **Client Secret** → `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`

Add these to your `.env` file.

### 5. Generating a Cloak Key

The Prowl API key is encrypted at rest using AES-GCM. Generate a random 32-byte key and base64-encode it:

```bash
# In iex or any shell with Elixir available:
:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(32) |> Base.encode64() |> IO.puts()
```

Add the output to `.env` as `CLOAK_KEY=<output>`.

In dev, if `CLOAK_KEY` is not set, a fixed placeholder key is used automatically so the app starts without configuration.

---

## Weather Integration

The dashboard shows current conditions and a contextual planting tip powered by [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Set `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` in `.env`. Location format must be `City,CountryCode` (e.g. `Victoria,CA`) — province/state names are not supported by the API. The weather card is silently hidden if the key is missing.

## Implementation Plan

See [Plan.md](./Plan.md) for architecture decisions, data model, UI mockups, and phased implementation tasks.

Detailed task-by-task plans are in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Deployment

Live at **[https://backyardgarden.fly.dev](https://backyardgarden.fly.dev)**

Deployed on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) (SJC region) with a Fly Postgres cluster. CI/CD via GitHub Actions — pushes to `main` run tests then auto-deploy.

### Ongoing Deploys

Pushes to `main` trigger CI automatically:
1. `quality` job — tests, credo, sobelow, format check
2. `deploy` job — `flyctl deploy --remote-only` on success

To deploy manually:
```bash
fly deploy --remote-only -a backyardgarden
```

### Monitoring

```bash
fly logs -a backyardgarden          # live logs
fly status -a backyardgarden        # machine state
fly ssh console -a backyardgarden   # shell inside running machine
```

---

### Setting Up from Scratch

If you ever need to recreate the Fly.io deployment, follow these steps in order. There are several non-obvious gotchas documented below.

#### 1. Install and authenticate flyctl

```bash
brew install flyctl
fly auth login
```

#### 2. Create the Fly app

```bash
fly apps create backyardgarden --org personal
```

> **Do not use `fly launch`** — it calls `mix phx.gen.release --docker` internally, which fetches Docker Hub at runtime and can fail. It also creates files without executable bits and may leave the app in a broken network state if it fails partway through. Create the app manually and write `Dockerfile` + `fly.toml` by hand instead.

#### 3. Attach Postgres

```bash
fly postgres attach backyardgarden-pg --app backyardgarden
```

This sets `DATABASE_URL` as a Fly secret automatically. If you get "database user already exists", connect to the cluster and drop the orphaned user first:

```bash
fly postgres connect -a backyardgarden-pg
# then: DROP USER backyardgarden; \q
```

#### 4. Set secrets

```bash
# Generate values:
mix phx.gen.secret                                          # → SECRET_KEY_BASE
mix run -e 'IO.puts Base.encode64(:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(32))'  # → CLOAK_KEY

fly secrets set \
  SECRET_KEY_BASE="..." \
  CLOAK_KEY="..." \
  AUTH0_DOMAIN="your-tenant.auth0.com" \
  AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="..." \
  AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET="..." \
  OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="..." \
  -a backyardgarden
```

Non-sensitive config lives in `fly.toml` under `[env]` (committed to git): `PHX_HOST`, `PHX_SERVER`, `DEFAULT_LOCATION`, `ECTO_IPV6`.

#### 5. Fix executable bits on release scripts

`mix phx.gen.release` creates the overlay scripts without the executable bit:

```bash
chmod +x rel/overlays/bin/server rel/overlays/bin/migrate
git add rel/overlays/bin/server rel/overlays/bin/migrate
git commit -m "fix: set executable bit on release scripts"
```

Without this the machine will crash on every start with `Permission denied (os error 13)`.

#### 6. Dockerfile build order

Phoenix 1.8 colocated hooks generate a `phoenix-colocated/backyard_garden` package during `mix compile`. The Dockerfile **must** run `mix compile` before `mix assets.deploy` or esbuild fails with `Could not resolve "phoenix-colocated/backyard_garden"`.

#### 7. IPv6 sockets for Ecto (critical)

Fly's private network is **IPv6-only**. Erlang defaults to IPv4 sockets, so all `.internal` connections fail with `:nxdomain` unless you explicitly opt in.

In `fly.toml`:
```toml
[env]
  ECTO_IPV6 = "true"
```

In `config/runtime.exs` (prod block):
```elixir
maybe_ipv6 = if System.get_env("ECTO_IPV6") in ~w(true 1), do: [:inet6], else: []
config :backyard_garden, BackyardGarden.Repo,
  url: database_url,
  socket_options: maybe_ipv6
```

Without this you will get endless `:nxdomain` errors even though DNS is configured correctly.

#### 8. Machine memory

256MB causes OOM kills on BEAM startup. Use 512MB minimum:

```toml
[[vm]]
  memory = "512mb"
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
```

#### 9. Health checks and force_ssl

Fly's internal HTTP health checks hit port 4000 directly **without** `x-forwarded-proto`, so `force_ssl` returns 301, marking the machine critical and blocking all traffic.

Either omit `[[http_service.checks]]` entirely (current setup), or add a dedicated `/health` endpoint excluded from SSL:

```elixir
# prod.exs
config :backyard_garden, BackyardGardenWeb.Endpoint,
  force_ssl: [rewrite_on: [:x_forwarded_proto], exclude: [paths: ["/health"]]]
```

#### 10. GitHub Actions CI/CD

The deploy job uses `superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master`. The binary it installs is `flyctl`, not `fly`:

```yaml
- uses: superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master
- run: flyctl deploy --remote-only
  env:
    FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
```

Generate the token with:
```bash
fly tokens create deploy -a backyardgarden
```

Add it as `FLY_API_TOKEN` in GitHub → repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

> The token may need to be regenerated if it becomes unauthorized — this has happened after app recreation. Just run `fly tokens create deploy` again and update the GitHub secret.

#### 11. Auth0 production URLs

In Auth0 dashboard → your app → Settings, add alongside the localhost URLs:

- **Allowed Callback URLs:** `https://backyardgarden.fly.dev/auth/auth0/callback`
- **Allowed Logout URLs:** `https://backyardgarden.fly.dev`

---

## Prowl Notifications

Receive iOS push notifications for planting events and seedling reminders.

### Setup

1. Install [Prowl](https://www.prowlapp.com/) on your iOS device (free app)
2. Get your Prowl API key from [https://www.prowlapp.com/](https://www.prowlapp.com/)
3. Add it via the settings page at `/settings/notifications`
4. Set your preferred morning and evening reminder times on the same page

### Hourly Job

The app includes an Oban job (`HourlyCheckWorker`) that runs at the top of every hour. For each user it checks whether the current local hour matches their configured morning or evening reminder time, then sends the appropriate notifications.

**Morning checks:**
- **Plant Now** — seeds whose ideal planting window is open and haven't been planted yet
- **Harvest Soon** — planted items within 7 days of harvest maturity
- **Sow Now** — seedling plantings where today is the calculated indoor sow date
- **Start Hardening** — seedlings that are ready to begin outdoor hardening
- **Hardening Morning** — reminder to take seedlings outside (skipped if a weather warning is sent instead)
- **Hardening Weather Warning** — rain, high wind (>40 km/h), or heat (>30°C) forecast; warns to keep seedlings inside

**Evening checks:**
- **Hardening Evening** — reminder to bring seedlings inside for the night

Oban is fully enabled and running. Jobs are processed in dev and prod; tests use `Oban.Notifiers.PG` so no Postgres connection is required in the test environment.

## Supplier Catalog

Seed detail pages can show care information scraped from supplier Shopify stores. Three supported suppliers:

| Supplier | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| West Coast Seeds | westcoastseeds.com | Full catalog + care guide scraping |
| Metchosin Farm | metchosinfarm.ca | Full catalog |
| Brother Nature | brothernature.ca | Full catalog + "Seed Details" / "Instructions" scraping |

Three mix tasks manage this:

```bash
# Fetch and upsert all products from all three suppliers
mix supplier.scrape

# Scrape a single supplier
mix supplier.scrape west_coast_seeds
mix supplier.scrape metchosin_farm
mix supplier.scrape brother_nature

# Import a single product by URL (useful for products missed by the bulk scrape)
mix supplier.scrape https://www.westcoastseeds.com/products/bright-lights-1

# Fuzzy-match seeds to supplier products (auto-links ≥ 0.90 score, prints review list for 0.75–0.89)
mix supplier.match

# Manually link a seed to a product — accepts a UUID, handle, or full product URL
mix supplier.link <seed_id> <product_id|handle|url>

# Examples:
mix supplier.link <seed_id> https://metchosinfarm.ca/products/noche-zucchini
mix supplier.link <seed_id> https://brothernature.ca/products/cosmo-mix-seashell
mix supplier.link <seed_id> noche-zucchini
```

Run `mix supplier.scrape` first to populate the catalog, then `mix supplier.match` to link seeds. Re-running is safe and efficient — products already fully scraped are skipped (no HTTP fetch, no upsert). Progress is printed per-product with a final `upserted / skipped / errors` summary. The scraper recovers from transient DB connection drops with automatic retry.

---

## Seed Data

Seeds are user-owned — each user manages their own library. New users start with zero seeds and add them via the Add Seed page.

The app owner's initial 62 seeds were imported from CSV and can be backfilled after adding the `user_id` migration:

```elixir
# In iex -S mix
user = BackyardGarden.Users.get_user_by_email("your@email.com")
import Ecto.Query
BackyardGarden.Repo.update_all(
  from(s in BackyardGarden.Seeds.Seed, where: is_nil(s.user_id)),
  set: [user_id: user.id]
)
```

The global supplier catalog (West Coast Seeds + Metchosin Farm) is separate and powers the Add Seed browse/search workflow. Populate it by running `mix supplier.scrape`.

Original seed data sourced from:
- [Metchosin Farm Seed Library](https://metchosinfarm.ca/collections/all-seeds)
- [West Coast Seeds](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/)
- [Brother Nature Seeds](https://brothernature.ca/)
